### About the project

Health E AI assistant
By combining a custom conversant persona and grounded QA, Health-E is able to aid in processing patients, extracting relevant information to fill out forms, and providing advice common knowledge advice on applicable scenarios if prompted with a question. We hope this technology helps cut down healthcare costs by reducing queue times, paperwork, and increasing efficiency overall. Moreover, we envision applications of Health-E's underlying technology beyond the healthcare industry. In particular, regional economics and local communities in developing countries, that now have wide internet access, could greatly benefit from virtual advisors or teachers to supplement the lack of labor supply or poor level of education. We are really proud of what we built and we hope you enjoy both our presentation as well as experimenting with Health-E.
